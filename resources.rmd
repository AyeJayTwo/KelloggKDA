There are many resources for self-guided study. Check back here for updates!

## Stats Refreshers

Because DECS-430/431 was so long ago...

  * [Linear Regression](http://setosa.io/ev/ordinary-least-squares-regression/): cool, beautiful site that explains linear regression and ordinary least squared estimates! They have other awesome explanations but for really wonky statistical stuff (aside from PCA).
  * [Linear & Logistic Regression](http://r-statistics.co/Linear-Regression.html): good, general statistics knowledge

## Northwestern Resources

NU access required - check these out while you still have Northwestern student privileges! 

  * [Tableau License](https://www.tableau.com/academic/students): FREE Tableau license for students!
  * [DataCamp](http://www.it.northwestern.edu/research/campus-events/data-camp.html): AWESOME online courses for R, Python, and SQL. HIGHLY recommended for the programming basics and has stuff for more advanced topics. Follow the instructions from this NU site to get access to the advanced topics. Access has to be refreshed on a quarterly basis. 
  * [Northwestern R User Group](https://northwestern-r-users.github.io): Lots of good resources for R here from all the NU programs. Monthly classroom sessions on rotating topics. Sign up for the list-serve to get notifications. 
  * [Northwestern IT Training & Events](http://www.it.northwestern.edu/research/campus-events/index.html): Check back here for live workshops on Python & R
  * [Lynda](http://www.northwestern.edu/hr/workplace-learning/lynda/): Follow instructions at this link to get access to Lynda, a platform where instructors host video trainings (think Udemy, Udacity, and Khanh Academy)

## Example Problems and Walkthroughs

The best way to learn is to follow other peoples' work. Furthermore, there are SO many ways to do the same thing, and sometimes this is the best way to pick up new techniques. 

  * [Linear Regression in Python for Bay Area Home Prices](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/linear-regression-in-python-predict-the-bay-areas-home-price-5c91c8378878)
