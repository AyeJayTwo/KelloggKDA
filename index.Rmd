Welcome to the KDA Website! We created this site to foster community among Kellogg students who want to learn about data analytics. Our goal is to de-mystify analytics and to help YOU get smart on data. 

We understand that MBA students want to minimize time spent fiddling with code, so we will try to keep this as high-level and MBA-appropriate where possible. Stay tuned for new content, which we'll announce through the newsletter. 

If you have any questions or suggestions for content, feel free to reach out to us at kda@kellogg.northwestern.edu!
