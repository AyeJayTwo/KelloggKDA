Welcome to the KDA Website! We created this site to foster community among Kellogg students who want to learn about data analytics. Our goal is to de-mystify analytics and to help YOU get smart on data. 

We understand **the LAST thing** MBA students want to do is tweak and fiddle with code, so we will try to keep this as high-level and MBA-appropriate where possible. Stay tuned for new content, which we'll announce through the newsletter! 

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us at kda@kellogg.northwestern.edu.
